In year 2 you will be allocated to a placement  in the same hospital or geographically close as far as is possible.There is however no guarantee. The hospital in which you are placed in year 2 will dictate which School of Anaesthesia you are allocated to and thus which teaching programme and ARCP panel will apply to you. In year 3 you will join the Core Anaesthesia training programme for a further two years, these placements will again hopefully be within the same School of Anaesthesia that you have been allocated but there is no guarantee and you may be moved to a hospital in another School within the West Midlands region.","","",""
